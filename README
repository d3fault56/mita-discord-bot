# 💖 Mita — Yandere Discord DM Bot

Mita is a **Yandere-style Discord bot** inspired by characters like **Yuno Gasai**. She lives in your DMs, remembers what you say, grows more obsessive over time, unlocks lore through conversation, and checks on you if you disappear.

This project was built as a **personal learning project** combining Node.js, Discord.js, scheduled tasks, and lightweight memory persistence.
